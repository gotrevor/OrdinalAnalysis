  Predicative cut elimination for the ramified calculus.

  Pohlers' theorem is

      ⊢^α_{ρ ⊕ ω^ξ} Γ   ⇒   ⊢^{φ_ξ(α)}_ρ Γ,

  proved by main induction on `ξ` with a side induction on `α`.  `ξ = 0` is the
  elimination lemma (`ρ + 1`, cost `φ_0(α) = ω^α`); `ξ = 1` at `ρ = 0` is
  `ACAOmega/SecondCut.lean`'s `secondCutElimination` (`ω`, cost `ε_α`), the
  theorem that turns `ε₀` into `ε_{ε₀}`.  `Ramified/Rank.lean` puts the ranks of
  the level-`≤ ν` fragment below `ω · (ν + 1)`; the theorem at `ξ = 1` with base
  `ρ = ω · j` removes one such block at a time (`Ramified/BlockCut.lean`).

  This file factors the theorem into the part that is proof theory and the part
  that is ordinal arithmetic, proves the first in full generality, and proves the
  second at `ξ = 1`.

  * **`RankAbsorbed ρ σ V ξ`** is the arithmetic half, as a hypothesis: *every*
    cut rank below `σ` can be eliminated from `max ρ a` down to `ρ` at a cost
    that `φ_ξ(β)` absorbs.  It says nothing about derivations that
    `cutElimination_chain` does not already say; what it adds is a *uniform*
    bound over the whole rank segment, which is the only thing the side
    induction needs.

  * **`predicativeCutElimination`** is the proof-theoretic half: the side
    induction on the derivation, generic in `ξ ≥ 1` and in `ρ`, `σ`.  Every
    non-cut rule is rebuilt with `V.veblen_lt_right`; the cut is reduced at
    `max ρ (rank φ)` by `Ramified/Reduction.lean`'s `reduction` and then handed
    to `RankAbsorbed`, the resulting height staying below `φ_ξ(α)` by
    `V.redOrd_lt_veblen`.  This is the whole of `secondCutElimination`'s
    argument with the ε-specific steps abstracted away.

  * **`rankAbsorbed_of_chain`** discharges `RankAbsorbed` at `ξ = 1` from the
    finite-chain property "every rank below `σ` is finitely many predecessor
    steps above `ρ`", and `chain_of_lt_omegaPowLv_one` establishes that property
    concretely for `ρ = 0`, `σ = ω^1` in `Gamma0Note` — the analogue of
    `SecondCut.lean`'s `chain_of_lt_omegaN` for `NONote`.  Together they give
    **`predicativeCut_omega`** and, over `Gamma0Note` heights,
    **`secondCutEliminationR`**: `⊢^α_ω Γ ⇒ ⊢^{ε_α}_0 Γ`.  That is the ν = 1
    regression the design note asks for, reproducing the ε-jump in the ramified
    calculus.

  ## What is missing, and why

  `PredicativeCutStatement` is the general theorem, stated for heights and ranks
  both in `Gamma0Note`, and `predicativeCutStatement_of_absorbed` proves it *from*
  `RankAbsorbed` at every level.  So the residual obligation is exactly

      RankAbsorbed A I ρ (ρ ⊕ ω^ξ) veblenStructure ξ     for every ρ and every ξ ≥ 1,

  and it is pure ordinal arithmetic on `Gamma0Note`.  Unwinding Pohlers, the main
  induction on `ξ` discharges it from three facts none of which the repository
  has today:

  1. *(successor step)* for `ξ = η + 1`, every `a < ρ ⊕ ω^{η+1}` satisfies
     `a < ρ ⊕ ω^η · m` for some `m : ℕ`, and `ρ ⊕ ω^η · m` descends to `ρ` by `m`
     applications of the level-`η` case.  `Gamma0Note` has no multiplication, so
     even the statement `ω^η · m` has to be built (as an `m`-fold natural sum,
     with `nadd_lt_omegaPow` no longer available to absorb it).
  2. *(limit step)* for `ξ` a limit, every `a < ρ ⊕ ω^ξ` satisfies
     `a < ρ ⊕ ω^η` for some `η < ξ`.  This is a Cantor-normal-form statement
     about `Gamma0Note`; the type has `repr` into `Ordinal` and could get it that
     way, but there is no `Ordinal`-side decomposition lemma in the repository
     either.
  3. *(absorption)* `φ_η(x) < φ_ξ(β)` for `η < ξ` and `x < φ_ξ(β)`.  This one is
     *already available*: it is `V.veblen_lt_right` composed with
     `V.veblen_veblen_of_lt`, both fields of `VeblenStructure`.  So the Veblen
     package as it stands is sufficient for the general case; what is missing is
     entirely the rank-segment arithmetic of (1) and (2).

  Consequence: the general `ξ` is *not* blocked on anything
  proof-theoretic and does not touch `Ramified/Reduction.lean`.  It is an
  `Ordinal/` file about the rank notation, and it should be written there rather
  than here.

/-! ### The arithmetic half, as a hypothesis -/

/-- **The rank segment `[ρ, σ)` is absorbed by `φ_ξ`.**

For every cut rank `a` below `σ`, a derivation at rank `max ρ a` and height below
`φ_ξ(β)` can be brought down to rank `ρ` without leaving `φ_ξ(β)`.

`max ρ a` rather than `a`: the reduction lemma has to be applied at a rank that
is at least `rank φ` *and* at least `ρ`, because the two premises have already
been brought down to `ρ` by the side induction and `rank φ` may well be below
`ρ`.  `chain_max` is the lemma that makes this harmless.

At `ξ = 1` this is `cutElimination_chain` plus `omegaTower_lt_veblen`
(`rankAbsorbed_of_chain`).  In general it is the main induction on `ξ`, which is
where the remaining ordinal arithmetic lives; see the module docstring. -/

/-- **Raising the level.**  A segment absorbed by `φ_η` is absorbed by `φ_ξ` for
every `ξ > η`, because `φ_ξ(β)` is a fixed point of `φ_η`
(`VeblenStructure.veblen_veblen_of_lt`).

This is the third of the three facts the general main induction on `ξ` needs, and
the only one of the three the repository already has; the module docstring says
so, and this lemma is the proof.  It is what lets a level-`η` elimination be
*reused* at a higher level instead of re-proved. -/

This is the step the *successor* case of the general main induction iterates: a
rank in `[ρ ⊕ ω^{η+1})` is brought to `ρ ⊕ ω^η · m` and then walked down `m`
level-`η` steps.  What is missing for that is not this lemma but the arithmetic
that produces the finite `m` (module docstring, obstacle 1). -/

/-! ### The proof-theoretic half -/

/-- **Predicative cut elimination, given the rank arithmetic.**

A derivation at cut rank `σ` and height `α` becomes one at cut rank `ρ` and
height `φ_ξ(α)`, provided the rank segment below `σ` is absorbed by `φ_ξ`.

The proof is the side induction on the derivation.  Only the cut case does any
work: the two premises come back at rank `ρ` and heights `φ_ξ(β')`, `φ_ξ(γ')`,
both below `φ_ξ(α)`; they are raised to `max ρ (rank φ)`, reduced against each
other by `Ramified/Reduction.lean`'s `reduction`, which lands at
`redOrd (φ_ξ β') (φ_ξ γ')` — still below `φ_ξ(α)`, because `φ_ξ(α)` is closed
under the natural sum for `ξ ≥ 1` (`V.redOrd_lt_veblen`) — and the residual rank
is absorbed by hypothesis. -/

done: what is left is `RankAbsorbed` at each level, i.e. the statement that the
rank segment `[ρ, ρ ⊕ ω^ξ)` descends to `ρ` at a cost `φ_ξ` absorbs.  The `ξ = 1`
