  The glue: every axiom of `RAlt ν` (and of `RA Set.univ`) is derivable in the
  ramified ω-calculus, at a cut rank the level guard bounds.

  Three of `RAlt ν`'s four blocks are discharged by
  `Ramified/AxiomsLogic.lean` and `Ramified/AxiomsInduction.lean`
  (`eq_axiom_derivable`, `paMinus_axiom_derivable`, `induction_axiom_derivable`
  — none of which reads the level guard at all, since none of them cuts on a
  set atom).  The fourth, the naming schema, is `Ramified/NamingAxioms.lean`'s
  `naming_axiom_derivable`.  `RAlt_axiom_derivable` takes the naming case as a
  hypothesis `hnam`, in the same shape the other three blocks are stated in;
  the primed forms discharge it.

  `rank_evR_emb_lt_of_mem_RAlt` is the fact the level guard was introduced
  for: every axiom of `RAlt ν` (`ν ≥ 1`) has cut rank below `blkTop ν`, which is
  `ω · ν` at a finite `ν`
  (`Theory.lean`'s `lvlOf_emb_lt_of_mem_RAlt`, `Evaluate.lean`'s `lvlOf_evR`,
  and `Rank.lean`'s `rank_lt_blkTop_of_level`, composed).  This is what lets
  a proof from `RAlt ν` be replayed (`Ramified/Embed.lean`'s `replayR`) at a
  cut rank below that bound, which predicative cut elimination removes one block
  at a time (`Ramified/BlockCut.lean`).

  `RAlt_axiom_derivable'` and `RA_univ_axiom_derivable'` discharge the naming
  hypothesis with `Ramified/NamingAxioms.lean`'s `naming_axiom_derivable`.
