  The reduction lemma and the first cut-elimination theorem for the ramified
  calculus `RA_∞` (design D2).

  This is `ACAOmega/Reduction.lean` ported to `OmegaDerivableR`.  The
  architecture is unchanged: both sequents are related to the target by `⊆`, the
  recursion is on the symmetric measure `β ⊕ γ`, the ordinal delivered is the
  doubled natural sum `redOrd β γ`, and the induction over the *right* derivation
  is done once and generically (`reduction_right`) with one handler per rule that
  could be principal.  Three things are different, and all three are savings.

  * **There is no substitution provider.**  `ACAOmega`'s (∀₂)/(∃₂) principal case
    substitutes a *formula* for an eigenvariable, which is why that file threads a
    `SubstProvider` through all of its 1368 lines and why its calculus needs
    *general* identity (the atomic leaf `[t ∈ X, t ∉ X]` becomes `[ψ(t), ∼ψ(t)]`,
    derivable only at height `2·complexity ψ`, for which `redOrd β γ` has no
    room).  D2 performs no formula-for-variable substitution anywhere: a level-`ν`
    set quantifier is a number quantifier over codes, so the ω-rule and `exs`
    already handle it, and the only substitution in the calculus is of a *term*
    into the body of a code, which `rank_subst₁_le` says cannot raise the rank.  So
    identity stays atomic and the provider disappears.

  * **Two new rules, two new handlers, one new principal case.**  (Pr) and (Pr⁻)
    add a handler each to `reduction_right`; six of the seven pairs they form
    with the other rules are refuted by a head mismatch, and the seventh —
    (Pr)/(Pr⁻) on the same atom — is `Ramified/ReductionProbe.lean`'s
    `reduction_pr_principal`, which performs **one** cut (not the two nested cuts
    of the propositional cases) and so makes no new demand on the ordinal
    arithmetic.  The cut it performs is legal because
    `rank (A_a(n̄)) ≤ rank (body a) < blk (lvl a) ⊕ stage a = rank (n̄ ∈̇ ā) ≤ ρ`,
    which is `Ramified/Rank.lean`'s `rank_body_lt_memRank`: *the* lemma of the
    design, and the reason for the stage condition on codes.

  * **`MemFree` is a hypothesis of the whole lemma.**  A set atom is a literal,
    so `Literals` alone permits one as an axiom, and a (Pr) inference against
    such an axiom would be an irreducible principal case.  `MemFree A` — no axiom
    is a (Pr) or (Pr⁻) conclusion — rules it out, and `Ramified/Literals.lean`
    discharges it for the intended axiom sets.  This is the one genuinely new side condition of D2
    and it is why `reduction` carries an extra argument that
    `ACAOmega/Reduction.lean`'s does not.

  Cut ranks are ordinal notations (`Gamma0Note`), as in `ACAOmega`, so
  `PredBound`, `Chain` and `cutElimination_chain` are restated over `Gamma0Note`
  rather than `NONote`; nothing about them changes.

/-! ### Head mismatch

Six of the seven refutations each new rule contributes are "these two formulas
have different outermost symbols".  `Semiformula.rel`'s arity is an *index*, so
`injection` cannot be used and `simp` cannot always be relied on to normalise
`∼(memAt ν t s)` before unfolding it; a numeric tag read off the head, compared
by `congrArg`, is immune to both problems. -/

/-! ### The reduction ordinal is symmetric

`redOrd β γ = (β ⊕ γ) ⊕ (β ⊕ γ)` and the natural sum is commutative.  This is
what lets the (Pr⁻)/(Pr) principal case be the (Pr)/(Pr⁻) one with the two sides
exchanged, rather than a second proof. -/

/-! ### Two structural lemmas the reduction lemma needs

`Omega/Calculus.lean` proves `drop_falsum` for the first-order calculus and
`ACAOmega/Calculus.lean` proves `identity_cases` for the second-order one; both
are restated here because `OmegaDerivableR` has two constructors neither of them
knows about, and because identity here is *atomic*. -/

/-- `⊥` is a passenger: no rule introduces it, so it can only have entered by
weakening and can be dropped again.  Needed because the cut formula `⊤` has
`∼⊤ = ⊥`, and the reduction lemma then has to discharge a sequent carrying
one. -/

/-- **The right induction.**  Given the left derivation `hd` of a sequent inside
`φ :: Θ`, and a handler for each rule that could be principal for `∼φ` on the
right, reduce against any right derivation of a sequent inside `∼φ :: Θ`.

Seven handlers, one per rule that can put the principal formula at the head: the
five of `Omega/Reduction.lean` plus the two predicator rules.  Doing the right
induction once is what keeps the cost of eleven constructors linear rather than
quadratic — `ACAOmega/Reduction.lean` is 1368 lines for twelve constructors
