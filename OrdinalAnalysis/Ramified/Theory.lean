  The finitary theory of ramified analysis, `RA Λ` — design **D2**.

  The theory is a Foundation **first-order** theory, `RA (Λ : Set Lv) : Theory
  LRA`, i.e. a set of `Sentence LRA`.  So `Theory.Proof.provable_iff` applies
  unchanged — a proof unpacks to an `LK` derivation of `σ :: ∼axioms`, which
  `Ramified/Embed.lean` replays into `RA_∞` — and so does everything else
  Foundation has for first-order theories (soundness, completeness,
  compactness).

  Four groups of axioms.

  * `𝗘𝗤 LRA` — equality for the *entire* enlarged language.  This is what
    supplies congruence for `X` and for every `∈̇_ν`.
  * `Theory.lMap toLRA 𝗣𝗔⁻` — the axioms of `PA⁻`, transported.
  * `InductionScheme LRA Set.univ` — induction for **every** `LRA`-formula,
    including those mentioning `X` and the membership symbols.
  * `NamingAxioms Λ` — the **naming (comprehension) axioms**.

  ## The naming schema: one pair of axioms per formula, uniform in the code

  A level-`μ` set is a numeral `c = ⟨μ, s, ⌜A⌝, p⟩` (`Ramified/Code.lean`): a
  formula `A(x, p)` of shape `μ` with its parameter `p`, at a stage `s`.  For
  each level `μ ∈ Λ` with `μ > 0` and each formula `A` of shape `μ` the schema
  has the two axioms

      nameOutP μ A :≡ ∀c ∀p ∀s (G(c, p, s) → ∀x (x ∈̇_μ c → A(x, p)))
      nameInP  μ A :≡ ∀c ∀p ∀s (G(c, p, s) → ∀x (A(x, p) → x ∈̇_μ c))

  where the guard `G(c, p, s)` is the arithmetical formula
  `c = ⟨μ, s, ⌜A⌝, p⟩ ∧ A.complexity + stage p < s` (`Ramified/Guard.lean`).

  Three features, each forced.

  * **The parameter is a set of the same level.**  With parameter-free codes
    whose bodies mention only lower levels, every proof uses finitely many
    codes, and the level-`μ` sets it sees can be read level by level as
    explicit formulas of `PA[X]`: such a theory is conservative over `PA[X]`,
    however many levels it has.  A same-level parameter breaks this: at the jump
    formula the schema proves `∀z ∃w ∀x (x ∈̇_μ w ↔ J(x, z))`, closure of level
    `μ` under the jump uniformly in a level-`μ` set (`Ramified/Comprehension.lean`).

  * **The stage guard.**  Without it the schema is inconsistent:
    `A(x, p) :≡ x ∉̇_μ ⟨p, p⟩` would name, at `c = ⟨⌜A⌝, ⌜A⌝⟩`, a set with
    `x ∈̇_μ c ↔ x ∉̇_μ c`.  With it, a code is defined from a parameter of
    strictly smaller stage and membership is a recursion on (level, stage); the
    same inequality is what makes the predicator rule lower the cut rank
    (`Ramified/Rank.lean`).

  * **One axiom per formula, not per code.**  The code is a universally
    quantified number, so a single axiom speaks about every parameter at once —
    which is exactly what a comprehension principle with a set parameter has to
    do.  Everything about codes that the schema needs is arithmetic, and is
    decided in the guard; the schema needs no arithmetized syntax.

  The level of both axioms is `μ` (`lvlOf_nameOutP`, `lvlOf_nameInP`): the guard
  is arithmetical, `A` has shape `μ`, and the set atom sits at `μ`.  So the
  level guard of `RAlt ν` below is unchanged.  The parameter-free codes are the
  case where `A` is closed and the parameter is `0`
  (`Ramified/Comprehension.lean`'s `exists_naming`).

  ## The level guard on `RA_{<ν}`

  `RA Λ` puts *no* level restriction on its equality axioms or its induction
  scheme.  That is right for `RA Λ` itself, but wrong for `RAlt ν`, the theory
  of the sets of level `< ν`: `Ramified/Rank.lean` prices a level-`μ` set atom
  at up to `blkTop μ` (`ω·μ` at a finite `μ`), and predicative cut elimination consumes derivations whose
  cut rank sits below `blkTop ν` (`Rank.rank_lt_blkTop_of_level : lvlOf φ < ν →
  rank φ < blkTop ν`).  If `RAlt ν` contained the congruence axiom of `∈̇_μ` for some
  `μ ≥ ν`, or induction for a formula mentioning `∈̇_μ`, a derivation from
  `RAlt ν` could legitimately cut on a formula of rank `≥ blkTop ν`.

  So `RAlt ν` intersects each unrestricted block of `RA Λ` with the level
  condition it needs: the equality axioms are kept only when their embedded
  `Proposition` has level `< ν`, and the induction scheme is restricted from
  `Set.univ` to `{φ | lvlOf φ < ν}`.  The naming schema is graded
  (`NamingAxioms {μ | μ < ν}`), and `𝗣𝗔⁻` is levelless.  The upshot is
  `lvlOf_emb_lt_of_mem_RAlt`: *every* axiom of `RAlt ν` (for `ν ≥ 1`) has level
  `< ν`, which `Ramified/Axioms.lean` turns into the rank bound
  `rank_evR_emb_lt_of_mem_RAlt`.  `RAlt ν` is a strict subset of
  `RA {μ | μ < ν}` (`RAlt_subset_RA`).

/-! ### Level bookkeeping for the guard

Four lemmas about `lvlOf`, needed once each by `RAlt`'s side conditions and by
`lvlOf_emb_lt_of_mem_RAlt` below.  None of them is specific to `RAlt`: they say
that `lvlOf` is blind to the `lMap`-transport of arithmetic, to universal
closure, and to the three occurrences of the body inside `succInd` — the same
kind of fact `Code.lean`'s `lvlOf_rew`/`lvlOf_neg` already record. -/

/-- **`lvlOf` does not see the passage from a closed `Proposition` to its
`Sentence` universal closure.**  `Semiformula.univCl X = X.univCl'.toEmpty _`
and `emb` inverts `toEmpty` (`emb_toEmpty`); `X.univCl'` is a `fixitr`-rewriting
of `X` under `∀¹*`, and neither move touches a relation symbol. -/

(definitionally) to three substitution instances of `φ` — at `0̄`, `#0` and

(`lvlOf_subst₁`), and neither does `→` (which is `∼_ ⋎ _`) or `∀¹`. -/
