  The cut-rank bound of `ACA_∞`'s axioms: `rank φ ≤ ω + complexity φ`.

  `ACA/Syntax.lean`'s `rank` pays a successor for every propositional and
  number-quantifier step and `max (succ · ) ω` for every set quantifier, while
  Foundation's `Semiformula.complexity` pays a plain `+ 1` for *all* of them,
  first- or second-order alike.  So by induction on the formula, `rank` never
  overtakes `omegaAdd complexity := ω + complexity`:

  * at a literal both sides are `0`;
  * at `⋏`/`⋎`/`∀¹`/`∃¹`, `rank` takes a `NONote.succ` and `complexity` a
    `+ 1`, and `succ_omegaAdd_le` (via `NONote.repr_succ`,
    `Ordinal/NONoteSucc.lean`) says these match: `succ (ω + c) ≤ ω + (c+1)`;
  * at `∀²`/`∃²`, `rank` additionally takes a `max · ω`, absorbed because
    `omegaN ≤ omegaAdd _` (`omegaN_le_omegaAdd`, already in
    `ACAOmega/SecondCutEv.lean`).

  The rest of the file packages this into the exact shape
  `ACAOmega/Axioms₂.lean`'s `cut_axioms₂_of` consumes: a rank bound `ρ'`
  together with `∀ σ ∈ Δ, rank (ev₂ σ) < ρ'` for a finite list `Δ`, with
  `ρ' := omegaAdd k` for `k` one more than the largest complexity on `Δ`.
