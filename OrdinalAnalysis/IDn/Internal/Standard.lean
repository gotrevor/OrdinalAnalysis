  The coding of the multi-level ϑ-notation in the standard model, generalizing
  `ID1/Internal/Standard.lean`.

  Only the order-free predicates of `Codes.lean` are bridged here (`isTermb`, `ilen`, `iinE`,
  `iinG`): in `ℕ` the term recogniser accepts exactly the codes of terms, so the arithmetic
  formulas mean what they say.  The order (`iltb`), normal-form (`isNFb`) and domain (`isDom`)
  predicates are not built in `Codes.lean` (see its module docstring), so there is nothing to
  bridge for them here.

/-! ### The slot check

The one way the level-tagged coding could silently go wrong is the level swapped somewhere in
`tcOmega`/`tcTheta`/`inEStep`/`inGStep` — e.g. `E_0` and `E_1` collapsing to the same clause, or
`iinE`/`iinG` reading the wrong coordinate of the position pair.  Checked here on concrete small
terms with genuinely different levels, per clause, exactly as `SlotCheck.lean` did once for `ID1`. -/

(`0 ≤ 1` fails), so `E_0` drills to the inner `ϑ₀`-subterm; the outer `ϑ₁` is its own `E_1`. A
level swapped in the `≤`-test of `inEStep` would make one of these two facts fail. -/
