  The Buchholz–Pohlers analysis of `ID_n` and `ID_{<ω}`, both halves, mirroring
  `OrdinalAnalysis.ID1.Theorem2`'s `id1_theorem`.

  * **Upper bound** (`Upper.idn_upper_bound'`; Arai, arXiv:2304.00246, §1.6, already merged
    and hypothesis-free): for every notation `a ≺ c_n`, `IDn n (WForms F n)` proves `TI_a`.
  * **Lower bound** (`idn_lower_bound`, `IDn/LowerBound.lean`): `IDn n (WForms F n) ⊬
    TI_{Omega 0}`, given `EmbedHyps` and `CollapseCorollary` (the one open link, see that
    file's header).

  These two do not meet at the same bound (`c_n < Omega 0`, `ThetaWNoteD.c_lt_Omega` or
  similar order fact): the upper bound reaches every notation strictly below the sharp
  Buchholz–Pohlers ordinal `c_n`, the lower bound only rules out the whole field up to
  `Omega 0`. Closing the gap needs the sharp lower bound `idn_lower_bound_c` at `a := c n`,
  which could not be closed either (a missing tower-cofinality
  fact, on top of `CollapseCorollary`) — not attempted again here. `idn_theorem` below states
  precisely what is proved: the sharp upper bound and the (non-sharp, hypothesis-gated) lower
  bound, conjoined honestly, not silently narrowed to look tight.

  `Upper.idn_upper_bound'` is stated for `Internal.codedOrderFacts.toOrderFormulas`; this
  file's lower bound is stated for `Upper.orderFormulas` (chosen
  to avoid defeq friction with `IDn/Internal/OrderBridge.lean`). The two are equal by
  `rfl` (`orderFormulas_eq_codedOrderFacts`, checked live) — different declared constants with
  identical underlying `Σ₁` definitions — so the conjunction below states both halves for
  `Upper.orderFormulas` via that bridge.

  **`idlt_theorem`.** The upper half (`Upper.idlt_upper_bound'`) is merged and
  hypothesis-free. The lower half needs `IDlt (WFormsOmega F) ⊬ TI_{Omega 0}`; `provable_IDlt_iff`
  reduces this to `∀ m, IDseq (WFormsOmega F) m ⊬ TI_{Omega 0}` (`Union.lean`), but translating an
  `IDseq`-derivation (in `LXIomega` directly) down to an honest `IDn m` one (in the smaller
  language `LXIn m`, what `idn_lower_bound` is about) is a translation-of-derivations lemma
  `Union.lean`'s own docstring says is **not built** ("pushing this further down into an honest
  `IDn m A'` ... is true as well ... but is not built here"). Kept as a further explicit
  hypothesis, `IDseqToIDn`, alongside `EmbedHyps`/`CollapseCorollary` for every level.
