  The lower bound for `IDn n (WForms orderFormulas n)`, propagated upward from `Omega 0` to
  every larger bound.

  `IDn/LowerBound.lean`'s `idn_lower_bound` gives `IDn n (WForms orderFormulas n) ⊬
  tiUptoSentence orderFormulas (Fin n) (Omega 0)`. Since `TI_a(≺, X)` is monotone in `a` (a
  bigger field only makes the induction hypothesis `Prog(≺, X)` harder to discharge down to
  `X`, so `TI_a ⊢ TI_{a'}` whenever `a' ≤ a`), unprovability at the smaller bound `Omega 0`
  gives unprovability at every `a ≥ Omega 0` too — the direct analogue of the trivial
  `tiFieldSentence`-vs-`tiUptoSentence Omega` rewrite `ID1.Theorem.id1_theorem'` does for `ID₁`
  (there a pure renaming, since `ID1` has no `a`-parametrised family to begin with; here a
  genuine, if easy, corollary, because `IDn`'s `tiUptoSentence` already is one).

  **The one added hypothesis (`TiMonotoneProvable`).** Running this argument needs the
  monotonicity implication itself *derivable* inside `IDn n (WForms orderFormulas n)`, not
  merely true — a first-order consequence of the arithmetized fact `∀x (x ≺ ⌜Omega 0⌝ → x ≺
  ⌜a⌝)` (itself provable in `𝗣𝗔⁻ + IΣ₁` from order transitivity plus the numerical fact
  `Omega 0 ≼ a`, both plausible but not composed anywhere: `grep`ped `IDn/*.lean` for
  `trans`/`provable` combined with the internal order — nothing). Kept as an explicit
  hypothesis in exactly the shape `Entailment.mdp` needs it in so
  that closing it later is a one-line application, not a restatement of this file.
