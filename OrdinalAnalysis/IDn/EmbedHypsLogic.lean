  Bridge lemmas from `IDn/AxiomsLogic.lean` (`_al` suffix: `AxDerivable_al`, height convention
  `OmegaTwo_al := nadd (Omega (n-1)) (Omega (n-1))`) to `IDn/Embed.lean`'s `EmbedHyps` structure
  (`AxDerivable`, height convention `OmegaTwo := Omega (n-1) + Omega (n-1)`, ordinary `+`). The two
  files were written independently against the *same* `n`, but with genuinely different height
  notations for what is mathematically the same quantity `Ω_n · 2`; this file reconciles them
  field by field.

  **What reconciles by monotonicity alone (`eq_axiom`, `paMinus_axiom`).** Both
  `AxDerivable`/`AxDerivable_al` are `∃ m, ∀ H nice, IDnDerivable A zero H (height + ofNat m)
  [emb (embK σ)]`, so `AxDerivable_al A σ → AxDerivable A σ` reduces to a single inequality
  `nadd (OmegaTwo_al (n := n)) (ofNat m) ≤ OmegaTwo (n := n) + ofNat m` for every `m`
  (`nadd_omegaTwo_al_ofNat_le`), which is exactly `IDnDerivable.mono_height`'s hypothesis.
  This inequality is proved from two facts, neither needing an inequality in the *other*
  direction:

  * `OmegaTwo_al (n := n) ≤ OmegaTwo (n := n)`: in fact equality, since both are built over
    `Omega (n - 1)` (Embed's `OmegaTwo` was sharpened from `Omega n` to `Omega (n - 1)`):
    `nadd (Omega (n-1)) (Omega (n-1)) = Omega (n-1) + Omega (n-1)` by the
    next point.
  * `Omega j + Omega j = nadd (Omega j) (Omega j)` for every `j` — more generally,
    **the ordinal sum and the natural sum of `a` and `b` coincide whenever every entry of `a`
    dominates every entry of `b`** (`ThetaWNoteD.add_eq_nadd_of_forall_le`): both `addL` and
    `mergeL` on the two (already sorted, non-increasing) exponent lists then reduce to plain
    list concatenation, `addL` by definition (its filter keeps everything) and `mergeL` by
    induction using `mergeL_cons_cons_of_le` at every step. This is the general fact this file
    contributes to `Ordinal/ThetaW/Arith.lean`'s API; it is what lets `Ω_n + Ω_n` (Embed's
    convention) and `Ω_n ⊕ Ω_n` (AxiomsLogic's convention) — and, applied a second time,
    `(Ω_n ⊕ Ω_n) + ofNat m` and `nadd (Ω_n ⊕ Ω_n) (ofNat m)` — be identified, since `Omega j`'s
    own entries list is the singleton `[ThetaWTerm.Omega j]` (reflexivity supplies the
    domination) and `ofNat m`'s entries are `m` copies of the strictly smaller unit term
    (`ThetaWTerm.nil_lt_prin`).

  **What does not reconcile by monotonicity (`taut`).** `EmbedHyps.taut` needs derivability at
  height `rk ψ` (`IDn/Embed.lean`'s header: `IDn/Rank.lean` is additive, not `omegaMul`-wrapped,
  by design — this is *smaller* than `AxiomsLogic`'s `ID1`-ported Lemma 6.1, which delivers
  `omegaMul (rk ψ)` (`IDn.AxiomsLogic.taut`, ω · rk ψ, strictly larger than `rk ψ` for any
  `rk ψ ≠ 0`, since `rk ψ` is generally not additively principal — e.g. `rk` of a formula of
  positive complexity is `Omega _ + ofNat c` with `c > 0`, not a fixed point of `omegaMul`).
  `IDnDerivable.mono_height` only ever produces derivability at a *larger* height from a proof
  at a smaller one, never the reverse, so a proof at `omegaMul (rk ψ)` cannot be downgraded to
  one at `rk ψ` this way. `IDn.AxiomsLogic.taut` also needs `FamilyLevelBounded A`, which
  `EmbedHyps.taut` does not require at all. Bridging `taut` therefore needs a fresh proof of
  Freund's Lemma 6.1 under the additive height (re-running `taut_and`/`taut_all`/`taut_stage`'s
  ~300-line structural induction with `rk ψ` in place of `omegaMul (rk ψ)` throughout), which is
  left, together with `induction_axiom` (`AxiomsPA`, not yet ported to
  `IDn/`), `closure_axiom`/`indAx_axiom` (`AxiomsID`, likewise), and `replaceHeadNumI`
  (`Evaluate`), for later.
