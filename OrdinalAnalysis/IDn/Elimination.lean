  Cut elimination for cut ranks other than `Ω_k` (any level `k`), Freund's Exercise 7.1 (c).

  Source: A. Freund, *Impredicativity and trees with gap condition: a second course on
  ordinal analysis*, arXiv:2204.09321, Exercise 7.1 (c), with Exercise 7.1 (b) (reduction).

  **Exercise 7.1 (c).**  For a nice operator `H` and `ρ ≠ Ω`,

      H ⊢^α_{ρ+1} Γ   ⇒   H ⊢^{ω(α)}_ρ Γ.

  The proof is by induction on the derivation.  Every clause is repeated at the height
  `ω(α)`, with the premises of heights `ω(α₀) ≺ ω(α)`; the side conditions `γ ≺ α` and
  `Ω ⪯ α` persist since `α ⪯ ω(α)`.  A cut of rank `≺ ρ` stays a cut.  A cut of rank `ρ`
  (a cut formula of rank `≺ ρ + 1` has rank `⪯ ρ`) is removed by the reduction lemma,
  Exercise 7.1 (b), at the height `ω(α₀) + ω(α₀) ≺ ω(α)`.  Iterating, `H ⊢^α_{ρ+m} Γ`
  gives `H ⊢^{ω_m(α)}_ρ Γ` when none of `ρ, …, ρ + m - 1` is any `Ω_k`, where `ω₀(α) = α`
  and `ω_{j+1}(α) = ω(ω_j(α))`.

  **Scope of this port.**  Freund's Corollary 7.2 (embedding + iterated Exercise 7.1 (c) +
  collapsing, giving `H_η ⊢^{ϑη}_{ϑη} ψ⁺`) is *not* ported here.  This file covers Exercise 7.1 (b),(c) only; the multi-level
  collapsing corollary is `IDn/Collapsing.lean`'s job (station C4, Buchholz Theorem 4.8, §2.4),
  a different statement (no `ω_m(Ω+1)`-indexed embedding search) that is not written yet.
  Dropped from the mechanical draft: `collapsing_embedded`, `theta_omegaTower_lt`,
  `corollary_7_2`, `Omega_add_ofNat_succ`. (The draft's own use of a bare `ThetaWNoteD.Omega`,
  with no level argument, in that section was also a mechanical-translation bug — `Omega` always
  takes a level `: ℕ` — so it could not have compiled as generated regardless of scope.)

  **The reduction lemma, two forms.**  `IDn/Reduction.lean` (merged) supplies
  `IDnDerivable.reduction_cut`, whose rank side condition is *stronger* than the one-level
  source's: `∀ k : Fin n, ρ ≠ Ω_k`, not just `ρ ≠ Ω_{n-1}` — every level has its own `(Fix)`
  clause, so a cut of rank `ρ = Ω_j` for *any* `j`, not only the top level, can be principal, and
  `reduction_cut` needs `FamilyLevelBounded A` on top of that (`red_aux`'s docstring: needed for
  the multi-level form of `rk_unfold_lt_stageAt`, absent from the one-level source since there is
  only one level to bound). Below:

  * `elim_aux`/`elimination`/`elimination_iter` are the **concrete** theorems, using
    `IDnDerivable.reduction_cut` directly, with its real (stronger) hypotheses
    `hAb : FamilyLevelBounded A` and `hρ : ∀ k, ρ ≠ Ω_k`. These are what the rest of the
    development should call.
  * `elim_aux_of_hredCut`/`elimination_of_hredCut`/`elimination_iter_of_hredCut` are the
    **original hypothesis-form** theorems from before the reduction files merged, kept because
    their rank side condition (`ρ ≠ Ω_{n-1}` only, the literal one-level reading) is *weaker*
    than what `reduction_cut` actually needs, so they are not simply subsumed: they still say
    something `reduction_cut`'s own statement does not, for anyone who has (or later proves) a
    reduction lemma at the weaker hypothesis.

/-- **Hypothesis**: the reduction lemma at cut rank `ρ` (Freund, Exercise 7.1 (b)), in the
literal one-level form (`ρ ≠ Ω_{n-1}` only), used by the `_of_hredCut` theorems below. Packaged
as a `def : Prop` (rather than a bare `variable`) so it can be threaded as an *explicit* parameter
of every theorem that needs it: a `variable` is only auto-included in a declaration whose own
*stated signature* mentions it, not one that merely uses it inside the proof term, so a bare
`variable (hredCut : ...)` here would silently disappear from `elim_aux_of_hredCut`'s signature
(its header never spells out `hredCut`) and leave the tactic proof unable to see it. -/
