  Gentzen's jump, lifted along the columns of an omega-jump.

  For a set `Z` with omega-jump `Y` (`ACA/OmegaJump.lean`'s `IsOmegaJump(Y, Z)`),
  column `k + 1` of `Y` is exactly the (Gentzen) jump of column `k` of `Y`.  Lemma B
  (`Gentzen/Jump.lean`'s `jump_B`, instantiated over the coded Veblen ordering by
  `Gentzen/CodedVeblenJump.lean`'s `jumpB₁`) is a `paLX` theorem, generic in its unary
  parameter formula; applied to `columnXatFree` (`OmegaJump.lean`, the formula
  "membership in the column indexed by the free variable `k`") it is *automatically*
  universally closed over `k` as well, since `Semiformula.univCl` closes off every
  stray free variable of its argument, and `k` is `columnXatFree`'s only one.

  This file lifts that fact into the second-order syntax (`ACA/Lift.lean`'s
  `lift_paLX₀`), landing in `ACAplus` (`ACA` plus the omega-jump axiom): the full
  second-order induction scheme is unavoidable here because `lift_paLX`'s only route
  for discharging `paLX`'s induction axiom is `ACA`'s own scheme (an `ACAplus₀`-only
  route, while not ruled out mathematically, would need a lifting of `paLX`'s
  induction axioms into `ACA₀` through arithmetical comprehension and set induction).
