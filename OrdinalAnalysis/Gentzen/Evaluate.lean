  Closed-term evaluation: replacing a ground term by the numeral of its value.

  The ω-calculus of `Omega/Calculus.lean` quantifies over *numerals*: its `exs`
  rule admits `(∃¹ φ) :: Γ` only from a premise `inst φ n :: Γ`, and its
  `omegaRule` produces premises `inst φ n :: Γ`, one for each `n : ℕ`.
  Foundation's finitary `LK` (Basic/Calculus.lean:55-63) is not so disciplined:
  its `exs` rule takes an *arbitrary* term `t` as the witness.  Replaying an `LK`
  derivation inside the ω-calculus therefore needs a map that turns `φ/[t]` into
  the numeral instance — the evaluator of this file.

  Three things about the shape.

  * The value of a term is taken in `stdLX P₀` for one fixed reading `P₀` of `X`.
    That is not a choice: `X` contributes no *function* symbols to `LX`
    (`XLang.Func k = PEmpty`, Setup.lean), so `val_stdLX_congr` says term values
    do not see `P` at all.  `val_ground` upgrades this to independence of the
    two environments as well, for the terms that matter.

  * "Closed" is replaced by **ground** — no free variables *and* no bound
    variables (`Semiterm.bv t = ∅ ∧ t.freeVariables = ∅`).  At level `0` the two
    notions agree (`ground_of_closed`), but `ev` must also act underneath a
    quantifier, where `#0` is present and closedness alone would be the wrong
    test.  Ground is decidable, which is what lets `evT` be an honest `if` rather
    than a classical one, and hence lets `simp` compute with it.

  * `evT` is **deep**: a ground term becomes the numeral of its value, and a
    non-ground compound term is rebuilt from its evaluated arguments, so that a
    ground subterm sitting inside a non-ground one is normalised too
    (`&y + (2̄ + 3̄) ↦ &y + 5̄`).  Only the variables are left alone.

  ## Why the raw substitution law is false, and what replaces it

  The naive law `ev (φ/[t]) = (ev φ)/[n̄]`, with `n` the value of the ground term
  `t`, is **false for every evaluator whatsoever** — the obstacle is the
  statement, not the definition.  Take `φ := R(#0 + 1̄) : Semiformula LX ℕ 1` and
  a ground `t` of value `m`.  Then `φ/[t] = R(t + 1̄)` is ground, so any evaluator
  worth the name sends it to `R((m+1)‾)`; while `ev φ` must be some `R(s)` with
  `s/[m̄] = (m+1)‾` **for every `m`** — and no single term does that, since the
  numeral of `m + 1` is not a term-forming operation applied to the numeral of
  `m`.  (The previous, shallow `evT` avoided the issue by restricting to *flat*
  formulas, whose atoms carry no compound term in a bound variable.  That
  restriction is gone.)

  The ω-calculus instead instantiates its quantifier rules by substitution
  **followed by normalisation**, `inst φ n := ev (φ/[n̄])`.  What has to hold is
  then the *normalised* law

      ev (φ/[t]) = ev ((ev φ)/[n̄]),                                  `ev_subst_key`

  and that is a theorem, unconditionally, for the deep evaluator.  It is one line
  from two facts, each of independent use:

  * **congruence**, `ev_rew_ev : ev (ω ▹ ev φ) = ev (ω ▹ φ)` — normalising before
    a rewriting does not change the normal form afterwards;
  * **value dependence**, `ev_subst_ground : ev (φ/[t]) = ev (φ/[n̄])` — a
    substituted ground term is seen only through its value.

`ev` cannot tell two rewritings apart when they send each variable to terms with
the same normal form.  `evT t = evT u` is the right hypothesis rather than "both
ground with the same value" because it is *stable under rewriting*, which is what
the quantifier case of the induction needs — and it follows from congruence, so
this whole section costs nothing beyond what is already proved. -/
