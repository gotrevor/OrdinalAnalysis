  The class `C` of §C of the specification, and its
  closure under *premise-formation* — the operation the boundedness induction
  performs when it walks up an `OmegaDerivable` derivation.

  The boundedness lemma is an induction over `OmegaDerivable A numLX 0 α Γ` in
  which the hypothesis "`Γ ⊆ C`" must survive every rule.  Each rule of
  `Omega/Calculus.lean` replaces the principal formula of the sequent by one or
  more *premise* formulas:

  | rule          | principal | premises                   |
  |---------------|-----------|----------------------------|
  | `or`          | `φ ⋎ ψ`   | `φ`, `ψ` (in one sequent)  |
  | `and`         | `φ ⋏ ψ`   | `φ` and `ψ` (two sequents) |
  | `omegaRule`   | `∀¹ φ`    | `φ/[n̄]` for every `n`      |
  | `exs`         | `∃¹ φ`    | `φ/[n̄]` for one `n`        |
  | `contraction` | —         | a subsequent               |
  | `atom`, `identity`, `verum`, `cut` | — | none / two contexts |

  So what has to be proved is: *for every member of `C` and every rule whose
  principal formula it can be, the premises are again in `C`.*  That is the
  content of `InC.of_or`, `InC.of_and`, `InC.of_all`, `InC.of_exs` below, and of
  their sequent-level forms `InCSeq.of_or` … `InCSeq.of_subset`.

  Three design points.

  * **The ordering is a parameter.**  Everything below is stated for an
    arbitrary `C : CodedOrder O` (`Gentzen/CodedOrder.lean`) rather than for
    `precCode`; `C.prec` is the ordering's formula and `C.xfree_prec`,
    `C.freeVariables_prec` its two syntactic properties.  Nothing else about
    `C` is used in this file — the coding and the standard reading only enter
    with the boundedness lemma.  The `ε₀` case is `epsilon0Order`.

  * **`X`-freeness is structural.**  `XFree` is a `Prop`-valued recursion over
    `Semiformula LX ℕ n`: an atom is `X`-free when its relation symbol is
    `Sum.inl r` for an arithmetic `r`, and the connectives propagate.  It is
    preserved by every rewriting (`XFree_rew`) and by negation (`XFree_neg`),
    which is all the premise-formation lemmas need.  Its definition and lemmas
    now live in `Gentzen/CodedOrder.lean` — the structure has to speak of them —
    but in this namespace and under these names, so nothing moved as far as any
    other file is concerned.

  * **Head clashes are decided by a numeric tag.**  the pitfall notes: `⋏`, `⋎`,
    `∀¹`, `∃¹` are `LogicalConnective`/`Quantifier` *notation*, not
    constructors, so `injection` and `noConfusion` cannot be pointed at an
    equation between two of them.  `head : Semiformula LX ℕ n → ℕ` tags the
    outermost connective; every `head_*` lemma is `rfl`, and an impossible case
    such as "`φ ⋎ ψ` is `∼(Prog C.prec)`" becomes `(5 : ℕ) = 7`, which `simp`
    kills.  Same-head cases are settled by Foundation's `or_inj`, `and_inj`,
    `all_inj`, `exs_inj`.

  * **`InC` is inverted once.**  `InC.exhaustive` turns membership into a
    nine-way disjunction of *equations*; every later proof `rcases` that and
    never touches the inductive again.  This also gives the list
    the boundedness induction cases on.

  Traps hit, beyond the two `LowerSyntax.lean` already documents.

  * `Sum.noConfusion` cannot be applied to `h : (Sum.inr XRel.X : LX.Rel 1) =
    Sum.inl r`, even after ascribing the type to a literal `⊕`: the universe
    metavariable of `noConfusion` is never solved.  `simp at h` does work — the
    `reduceCtorEq` simproc sees the constructors.
  * `Structure XLang ℕ` must *not* become an instance: `Gentzen/StandardLX.lean`
    owns the standard model of `LX`.  The one place a model is needed here —
    numerals are injective — uses a `private def` of type `Structure LX ℕ`
    passed explicitly as `(str₂ := …)`, so nothing is registered.
