  Surjectivity of the notation coding onto the internally recognised codes, in `ℕ`.

  `NotationBridge.isNF_modelCode` says every external normal form is accepted by the
  arithmetized recogniser: `NF o → isNF (modelCode o)`.  This file proves the converse
  in the standard model — every number the *internal* recogniser accepts really is the
  code of a normal-form notation:

      isNF_surj : isNF (V := ℕ) n → ∃ o : NONote, nonoteCode o = n

  so that on `ℕ` the range of `nonoteCode` is exactly `{n | isNF n}`
  (`isNF_iff_exists_nonote`), and the coded ordering `precN` of `PrecStandard`
  never leaves that range (`precN_dom`).

  Two remarks on why this is cheap here.

  * The characterisation the induction needs is already isolated.  The
    `isNFb` is a course-of-values table, but `InternalONote.isNF_ocOadd`
    (InternalONote.lean:689) collapses one table step into

        isNF (ocOadd ec n rc) ↔ n ≠ 0 ∧ isNF ec ∧ isNF rc ∧ (rc = 0 ∨ icmp (ocExp rc) ec = 0)

    and `InternalONote.ocOadd_destruct` (:708) says every positive code *is* an
    `ocOadd`.  With `ocExp_lt_of_pos` / `ocTail_lt_of_pos` as the measure, strong
    induction on the code writes itself.

  * Nothing new is needed to rebuild the notation.  The fourth conjunct is exactly
    `ONote.TopBelow` read through the bridge: `icmp_modelCode_eq_zero_iff` turns the
    internal `icmp … = 0` into `ONote.cmp … = Ordering.lt`, which is the definition of
    `TopBelow`, and `Code.lean`'s `nf_oadd_iff` assembles `ONote.NF` from it.  The code
    equation is then `modelCode_oadd` read at `V := ℕ`, where `modelCode = code`.

  This is the fact the ε₀ lower bound was designed *around* — the parameter-free
  predicate `∀ o, code o = n → o < β` was chosen precisely so that surjectivity of
  `code` onto the internal `isNF` codes would not be needed for the ε₀ lower bound.
  It is proved here because the ε₁ pipeline (§24.6) parameterises the boundedness
  machinery over a coded ordering, and a decoding step is the natural way to state
  that the coded ordering and the notation ordering are the *same* order and not
  merely an embedding.

natural-number code.  (`PrecStandard.nonoteModelCode_nat` is this for normal forms;
the induction below meets arbitrary `ONote`s.) -/

/-- **Every internally recognised code is the code of a notation.**  Strong induction
on the code: `0` decodes to `0`, and a positive code is `ocOadd (ocExp n) (ocCoeff n)
(ocTail n)` by `ocOadd_destruct`, whose exponent and tail are smaller, so the induction
hypothesis supplies notations for them; `isNF_ocOadd` provides the four side conditions,
of which the coefficient one makes the `ℕ+` and the tail one becomes `ONote.TopBelow`
through `icmp_modelCode_eq_zero_iff`. -/
