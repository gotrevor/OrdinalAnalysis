  The replay of finitary derivations in the infinitary calculus.

  Every derivation of Foundation's one-sided LK becomes a derivation in the
  evaluating ω-calculus, at the same cut rank and the same ordinal height, of
  every numeral instance of its sequent — the free variable `x` sent to the
  numeral `f x`, every ground term then replaced by the numeral of its value.

  The statement is proved for all assignments `f` at once; that is what makes
  it an induction.  The cut rule may introduce a formula with free variables
  the conclusion does not have, so "closed" is not an invariant of the
  derivation, but "instantiated by `f`" is.  The two quantifier rules are the
  content.

  * `all` introduces a fresh free variable; the ω-rule asks for every numeral
    instance.  The premise under `n :>ₙ f` is the `n`-th instance of the
    conclusion's body under `f` (`NumSubst.numSubst_free`), the shifted context
    is unaffected (`seqSubst_shifts`), and the premise's evaluated form is the
    instance the ω-rule wants because evaluating the body first changes
    nothing (`EvInst.evInst_inst_ev`).

  * `exs` may use any term as witness; the ω-calculus only a numeral.  After
    the assignment the witness is a ground term, and the evaluator turns
    substitution by a ground term into substitution by the numeral of its
    value (`Evaluate.ev_subst_ground`).  This is the point of evaluating:
    without it the calculus could not replay an existential inference whose
    witness is compound, having no equality reasoning about `X`.

  Ordinals and ranks are `Proof/Bridge.ordN` and `Proof/CutRank.cutRank`,
  exactly as for the finitary indexed calculus.  The heights are an arbitrary
  `[OrdinalNotation O]`, matching `Omega/Calculus.lean` and `Proof/Bridge.ordN`:
  the replay is what carries a finitary proof into the infinitary calculus, and
  the results above `ε₀` need it to land in a notation system larger than
  `NONote`.  Every ordinal step it takes — `lt_succ`, `lt_succ_of_le`,
  `le_nadd_left`, `le_nadd_right` — is a lemma of the class.
