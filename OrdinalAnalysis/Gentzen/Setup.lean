  Gentzen 1943: the calibration half of `|PA| = ε₀`.

  Cut elimination bounds how *strong* PA is from above.  It says nothing about
  how strong PA is from below, and the two-sided statement `|PA| = ε₀` is the
  ordinal analysis proper:

    upper bound   for every notation `a` below `ε₀`,  `PA[X] ⊢ TI(≺, a)`
    lower bound   `PA[X] ⊬ TI(≺)`

  The upper bound is Gentzen's 1943 paper, *Beweisbarkeit und Unbeweisbarkeit
  von Anfangsfällen der transfiniten Induktion in der reinen Zahlentheorie*,
  Math. Ann. 119 (1943) 140–161.  Surveys of Lean, Coq, Isabelle, Agda, HOL
  Light, HOL4, Mizar, Metamath, ACL2 and Nuprl find it formalized nowhere: every
  system has ordinal notations, many have an object theory with a provability
  predicate, and no system joins them.  Coq's `hydra-battles` has both halves in
  one project and its documentation says the authors chose not to build the
  bridge.

  This file sets up the statement.  Three things about the shape.

  * The language is arithmetic *plus a fresh unary predicate* `X`, and the
    theory is PA with induction extended to every formula of that larger
    language.  Transfinite induction is asserted for an arbitrary predicate, not
    for a definable one, and that is what makes the result a statement about the
    *ordinal* rather than about a particular formula.

  * The ordering `≺` is a parameter.  Gentzen's argument is uniform in it: it
    needs a handful of laws about `≺`, `+` and `a ↦ ω ^ a`, and nothing else
    about how the notations are coded.  Isolating those laws as an interface
    separates the mathematics — the jump construction — from the arithmetization,
    which is the part that is large and which no library in any system currently
    has.

  * The universal quantifier over `a` lives in the *meta*-language.  There is one
    PA-proof for each notation, and no single PA-proof of all of them; that is
    exactly the content of the lower bound.  So the theorem to be proved is a
    Lean *function* from notations to derivations, not a derivation.

/-! ### The theory

`PA[X]`: equality for the entire enlarged language, the axioms of `PA⁻`
transported into it, and the induction schema for *every* formula of that
language — including those mentioning `X`.  The full equality theory supplies
congruence for the fresh predicate; transporting arithmetic equality alone
would not.  Extending induction to the new predicate is equally essential;
with induction only for arithmetic formulas the argument below collapses. -/

/-! ### Progressiveness and transfinite induction

With `≺` a binary relation of the extended language, written as a formula in
two variables:

* `Prog(≺)` says `X` is progressive — it holds at `x` whenever it holds
  everywhere below `x`;
* `TI(≺)` says progressiveness forces `X` to hold everywhere;
* `TIupto(≺, t)` restricts that conclusion to the notations below `t`, and is
  the form the upper bound proves, one instance at a time. -/

/-- `y ≺ x`, with `y` the innermost bound variable. -/
def precAt {n : ℕ} (y x : Semiterm LX ℕ n) : Semiformula LX ℕ n :=

/-- `TIupto(≺, t) :≡ Prog(≺) → ∀ x ≺ t, X x`.

This is the sentence the upper bound proves, once for each notation `t`.  The
unrestricted `TI` is what the lower bound refutes, and the gap between them is
the whole of the ordinal analysis. -/
