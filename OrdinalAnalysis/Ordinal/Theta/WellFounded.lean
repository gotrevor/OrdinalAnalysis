  The ϑ-order on normal terms is well founded.

  Source: T. Arai, *Lectures on ordinal analysis*, arXiv:2304.00246, §1.6 (Definition 1.27,
  Lemma 1.29, Lemma 1.33), where the argument is given for Buchholz's `ψ` inside `ID₁`,
  following the distinguished classes of Buchholz.  Here it is carried out for the ϑ-notation of Freund, arXiv:2204.09321,
  Definition 3.1, in the metatheory, where the accessible part `Acc` is available for all
  predicates at once.

  Write `W` for the accessible part of `≺` on normal terms.

  * (Arai, Definition 1.27.)  The distinguished class is `M = {α | E(α) ⊆ W}`: the terms all
    of whose ϑ-subterms at top level are accessible.  (Arai's `SC(α) ∩ Ω` becomes `E(α)`.)
  * (Sums.)  If every exponent of a normal sum lies in a class `S` closed under taking and
    forming sums, and is accessible for `≺` restricted to `S`, then so is the sum.  This is
    the usual double induction for the lexicographic order on non-increasing lists: on the
    first exponent, and for a fixed first exponent on the rest of the sum.
  * (Arai, Lemma 1.29, the inclusion `M ∩ Ω ⊆ W`.)  A term below `Ω` all of whose ϑ-subterms
    at top level are accessible is accessible, by induction on the length.
  * (`≺` restricted to `M` is well founded.)  Below `Ω` this is the previous item; `Ω` is
    accessible in `M` because everything in `M` below `Ω` is in `W`; a term above `Ω` is a sum
    whose exponents are shorter terms of `M`.  In Arai's setting this step needs the Gentzen
    jump (Lemmas 1.31 and 1.32) to reach each `ω_n(Ω + 1)`; in the metatheory an induction on
    the length of terms replaces it, since the exponents of a normal sum are subterms.
  * (Arai, Lemma 1.33, for ϑ.)  If `α ∈ M` and `ϑ ξ ∈ W` for all `ξ ∈ M` with `ξ ≺ α`, then
    `ϑ α ∈ W`.  Every `γ ≺ ϑ α` is shown to lie in `W` by induction on the length of `γ`.  A
    sum below `ϑ α` has its exponents below `ϑ α`.  For `γ = ϑ ξ`, Definition 3.1 (ii') of
    Freund leaves two cases: either `ξ ≺ α` and `E(ξ) ≺* ϑ α`, and then the elements of
    `E(ξ)` are shorter than `γ`, hence in `W`, so `ξ ∈ M` and `ϑ ξ ∈ W` by hypothesis; or
    `ϑ ξ ≼ δ` for some `δ ∈ E(α) ⊆ W`, and `W` is downward closed.
  * By induction along `≺` restricted to `M`, `ϑ α ∈ W` for every `α ∈ M`.  Then every term
    below `Ω` is in `W` (induction on the length: for `ϑ ξ` the elements of `E(ξ)` are shorter
    and below `Ω`, so `ξ ∈ M`), hence `Ω ∈ W`, and every term above `Ω` is a sum of shorter
    terms, hence in `W`.
