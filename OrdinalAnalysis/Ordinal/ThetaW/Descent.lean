  The multi-level ϑ-order on normal terms of all levels is not well founded.

  With unrestricted arguments of the collapsing functions and no bound on the levels, the
  clause at one level (`ϑ_k α ≺ ϑ_k β` if `α ≺ β` and `E_k(α) ≺* ϑ_k β`) admits the
  descending sequence
    `ϑ₀(Ω₂) ≻ ϑ₀(ϑ₁(Ω₃)) ≻ ϑ₀(ϑ₁(ϑ₂(Ω₄))) ≻ ⋯`,
  whose `m`-th term is `ϑ₀(ϑ₁(⋯ ϑ_{m-1}(Ω_{m+1}) ⋯))`.  Each step is the clause at level
  `0, 1, …` in turn, with the coefficient sets empty: the innermost comparison is
  `ϑ_m(Ω_{m+2}) ≺ Ω_{m+1}`, and `E_k` of a term all of whose collapses have level `> k` is
  empty.  All terms of the sequence lie below `Ω₁`, and all lie below the two-level term
  `ϑ₀(Ω₂)`; the `m`-th term uses the levels `0, …, m`.

  So well-foundedness can only hold for fragments with a bound on the levels (the two-level
  fragment is treated in the companion module on well-foundedness), or for a system with a
  side condition on the arguments of the higher collapses: G. Wilken, arXiv:2410.15953,
  §2.1, bounds the argument of `ϑ_j` by `Ω_{j+2}`, and in the simultaneous version
  (Definition 2.7 and Lemma 2.13 there) `α` is in the domain of `ϑ_m` only if the arguments of
  the collapses of level `> m` in `α` are below `α`, as in Buchholz's normal form for `D_v b`
  (all arguments of collapses of level `≥ v` inside `b` are below `b`).
