  Restricting a derivation to the notations below a bound.

  The rules of the ω-calculus mention the height only through `<` between a
  premise's height and the conclusion's, and the order of `Below ε` is the
  order of `O` on the underlying notations.  So a derivation whose height is
  below `ε` is, verbatim, a derivation in `Below ε`: every premise's height is
  below the conclusion's, hence below `ε` too.

  This is the step that puts the ε₁ lower bound into the notation system it
  has to be stated in.  Boundedness reads a derivation's `X`-atoms as codes of
  elements of its height system, and the induction axiom it refutes is
  transfinite induction along all of that system's coded ordering; for
  `|PA + TI(ε₀)| = ε₁` the system must therefore be exactly the notations
  below `ε₁`, while the derivations are built in the Veblen notations at
  large and only afterwards seen to stay below `ε₁`.

  The `OrdinalNotation (Below ε)` instance plays no role in the proof — only
  `<` is used — but the calculus cannot be *stated* at `Below ε` without it.

  One elaboration point: the height is written `Below.mk α hα` rather than
  `⟨α, hα⟩`, because the anonymous constructor reports its type as the
  subtype `{o // o < ε}` and instance search then cannot find the
  `OrdinalNotation` instance, which is declared on the `def` `Below ε`.
