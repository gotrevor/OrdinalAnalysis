  The infinitary calculus.

  Cut elimination for first-order logic does not give consistency of arithmetic,
  because the induction axioms are not logical validities: they enter a
  derivation as extra hypotheses, and cut elimination does not remove them.
  Gentzen's answer is to replace the induction schema by a rule with infinitely
  many premises, so that arithmetic becomes *logic* over the standard model and
  the only remaining axioms are true atomic sentences.

  That rule is the ω-rule: to conclude `∀x φ(x)` it is enough to have derived
  `φ(n̄)` for every numeral `n̄`.  Its dual is that `∃x φ(x)` may only be
  concluded from a numeral instance, not from an arbitrary term.  The two
  together make the quantifier cases of the reduction lemma trivial — the
  existential side hands over a numeral, and the universal side already has that
  very premise — which is why this file does not need, and does not have, a
  substitution lemma, a context shift, or an inversion lemma.  Those were the
  three most painful parts of the finitary development.

  Three things about the shape.

  * How a quantifier is instantiated is a parameter `I : Instantiation L` — a
    family of numerals together with a normaliser that is applied after
    substitution — not something the rule picks.  If each application could
    choose its own family the rule would be unsound outright: take the constant
    family and every `∀x φ(x)` follows from `φ(0)`.

    The normaliser is Buchholz's convention that closed terms are identified
    with their values, made explicit.  It is not decoration.  With plain
    substitution the ω-rule's premises for `∀x X(x + 1)` are the formulas
    `X(n̄ + 1)`, which are unrelated atoms to `X(n+1‾)`; an embedding of PA[X]
    that evaluates closed terms then has nothing to feed the rule, and one that
    does not evaluate them cannot replay an existential inference whose witness
    is a compound term, because the calculus has no equality reasoning about
    `X`.  Requiring only two laws of the normaliser — it commutes with negation
    and preserves complexity — keeps every proof in this directory unchanged,
    and plain substitution is the instance `Instantiation.raw`.

  * The ω-rule's premises get *individual* ordinals `β n`, not one shared bound.
    This is not fussiness.  The whole point of the rule is to derive the
    induction axiom, and the derivation of `φ(n̄)` from the induction step is `n`
    inferences long, so its height grows with `n`.  A shared bound would make
    the induction axiom underivable and the entire construction pointless.

  * The finitary calculus is not superseded.  It carries cut elimination with an
    explicit ordinal bound for pure first-order logic, which is a separate
    result, and `Bridge.lean` connects it to Foundation's semantics.

  * The heights are an arbitrary `[OrdinalNotation O]` (`Ordinal/Notation.lean`),
    not `NONote`.  Nothing in this directory uses anything about `NONote` beyond
    the order arithmetic that class collects, and the results above `ε₀` need
    larger notation systems; taking `O := NONote` gives back exactly what was
    here before, which is what the `Gentzen/` files still do.

/-- The atomic axioms of the infinitary calculus: a set of closed literals,
consistent, and containing nothing but literals.

This is the third thing the ω-calculus needs beyond logic, and the one the
first version omitted.  The identity rule derives `φ, ∼φ` for any atom, but
nothing derives a *true* closed atom such as `0 + 0 = 0` on its own — and the
axioms of `PA⁻`, once the universal quantifiers have been discharged by the
ω-rule, are exactly such atoms.  Without them arithmetic cannot be embedded.

Consistency is what the reduction lemma consumes: a cut on an atomic formula
whose two premises are both axioms is the one case that cannot be reduced, and
consistency says it does not arise.  Literal-only is what keeps every other case
of the reduction lemma unchanged: an axiom is never the principal formula of a
propositional or quantifier rule. -/
