  Inversion for the universal quantifier.

  This is the last inversion the reduction lemma needs.  When the cut formula
  is `∀¹ χ`, its negation is `∃¹ (∼χ)`; the existential side supplies a witness
  `t`, and the universal side has to be instantiated there.

  The principal case is the only one that is not bookkeeping: from a premise
  `⊢^β χ.free :: Γ'ˡ⁺` one substitutes `&0 ↦ t` and every later free variable
  back down, which turns `χ.free` into `χ/[t]` and undoes the shift on the
  context.  Both facts are Foundation's: `rewrite_free_eq_subst` and
  `rewrite_comp_shift_eq_id`.
