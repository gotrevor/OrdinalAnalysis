  The elimination lemma: one level of cut rank costs one exponentiation.

  Given a derivation of ordinal height below `α` whose cuts all have complexity
  at most `r`, it produces one of height below `ω ^ α` whose cuts all have
  complexity strictly below `r`.  Iterating it `r` times drives the rank to
  zero, and a rank-zero derivation is cut free.

  The cut case does not split.  A cut admitted at rank `r + 1` has
  `φ.complexity < r + 1`, which is `φ.complexity ≤ r`, which is exactly the
  reduction lemma's hypothesis — so *every* cut is reduced, not only the maximal
  ones, and no case analysis on the rank is needed.

  The ordinal accounting is where `ω ^ α` earns its place.  The two premises
  land at `ω ^ β` and `ω ^ γ` with `β, γ < α`, so both are below `ω ^ α`; the
  reduction lemma returns their doubled natural sum, and `ω ^ α` is additively
  indecomposable for the natural sum, so that is still below `ω ^ α`.  This is
  also the retroactive justification for the reduction lemma's doubling: any
  natural-sum slack is invisible here.
