  The cut rank of an LK derivation.

  `Foundation` supplies the Tait-style one-sided calculus and the predicate
  `FinDerivation.IsCutFree`, but no numerical measure of how much cutting a
  derivation does.  Gentzen's argument needs one: the elimination lemma peels
  off cuts one rank at a time, and the ordinal bound is a tower whose height is
  the rank.

  `cutRank d` is `0` when `d` uses no cut, and otherwise one more than the
  complexity of the most complex cut formula in `d`.
