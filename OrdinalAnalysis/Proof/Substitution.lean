/-
  Derivations are closed under substitution of free variables, at the same
  ordinal and the same cut rank.

  This is the prerequisite for inverting the `∀` rule: the reduction lemma
  takes the witness `t` from the `∃` side and needs the `∀` side instantiated
  at `t`.

  The proof mirrors Foundation's `LK.Derivation.rewrite` for concrete derivations.
  Two things are forced.  The substitution must be quantified *inside* the
  induction, because the `∀` case applies the induction hypothesis at a
  different substitution `g`.  And the cut case needs
  `Semiformula.complexity_rew`: substitution does not change the complexity of
  a formula, so the rank side condition survives.

/-- Shifting the whole context preserves derivability.  Needed by the `∀` case of
the reduction lemma: that rule shifts its context, so the cut formula has to be
shifted along with it.

Foundation defines `LK.Derivation.shift` the same way, as `rewrite` at
`fun x ↦ &(x+1)`; `Γ.map (Rew.rewriteMap Nat.succ ▹ ·)` is `Γˡ⁺` definitionally. -/
