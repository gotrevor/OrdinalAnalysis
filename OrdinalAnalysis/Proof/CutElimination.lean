  Cut elimination with an explicit ordinal bound.

  Iterating the elimination lemma `r` times drives the cut rank to zero, at the
  cost of an `r`-fold tower of `ω`-powers over the original height.  At rank
  zero the cut rule is unavailable — it would need a formula of complexity
  strictly below `0` — so a rank-zero derivation is cut free by construction,
  and any induction over one discharges the cut case with `Nat.not_lt_zero`.

  Two things are worth saying about the bound.

  It stays below `ε₀`, and that is free rather than proved.  `NONote` is the
  type of ordinal notations in Cantor normal form, which is to say exactly the
  ordinals below `ε₀`; the tower is built inside that type, so the statement
  "the bound is below `ε₀`" is discharged by the type of the bound.  This is the
  payoff for indexing the calculus by notations rather than by `Ordinal`.

  And it is a genuine bound, not merely an existence claim.  Foundation proves a
  Hauptsatz for the same calculus by the algebraic route — a negative
  translation into minimal logic and a Kripke-style forcing argument — which
  establishes that a cut-free derivation exists but tracks no height at all.
  The bound is the whole content of the ordinal analysis, so the two results are
  not interchangeable.

/-- **Cut elimination.**  Every derivation of cut rank `r` and height below `α`
becomes a cut-free one of height below the `r`-fold `ω`-tower over `α`. -/

/-- At rank `0` the cut rule cannot fire, because its side condition asks for a
formula of complexity strictly below `0`.

Every induction over a rank-zero derivation therefore has a vacuous cut case,
and this is the lemma that closes it. -/

/-- A rank-zero derivation really is cut free: an induction principle with no
cut case at all.

Stated as a recursor rather than left implicit, because everything downstream —
the subformula property, and the reflection argument that turns a cut-free proof
of a false sentence into a contradiction — is an induction over exactly this. -/
