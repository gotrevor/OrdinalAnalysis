  The reduction lemma — the gatekeeper of Gentzen's argument.

  Given two derivations that cut against each other on a formula of complexity
  at most `r`, it produces a derivation of the combined sequent that uses only
  cuts of complexity strictly below `r`.  It is what lets the elimination lemma
  peel the cut rank down one level at a time, and it is the only place the
  natural sum is unavoidable.

  Four things fix the shape of the proof, and each of them was arrived at by
  first trying the obvious alternative.

  * Both sequents are related to the target by `⊆` rather than being literally
    `φ :: Θ`.  Foundation's structural rule is subset-based, so from a
    head-shaped hypothesis the `contraction` case learns nothing about the shape
    of its premise and the induction cannot proceed.

  * There is no inversion lemma anywhere in this file, and there cannot be one.
    The natural plan — induct on the left derivation, and in the principal case
    invert the right one to expose the subformulas of `∼φ` — breaks at the
    universal quantifier, where it would need an inversion for `∃`.  No such
    lemma exists: the witness a derivation chose is not recoverable from its
    conclusion.  Both quantifier cases instead take the witness from whichever
    premise has one and instantiate the other side at it.

  * The recursion is on the *symmetric* measure `β ⊕ γ`.  The quantifier
    principal cases produce their second cut premise by running the reduction
    with the two sides swapped, and a measure counting only the left ordinal
    cannot see that as a decrease.

  * The ordinal delivered is `(β ⊕ γ) ⊕ (β ⊕ γ)`, not the textbook `β ⊕ γ`.
    The propositional principal cases perform two *nested* cuts, so they need
    two strictly increasing ordinals above everything the hypotheses return, and
    the plain natural sum supplies only one.  Doubling is the cheapest repair
    that survives the recursion, and the elimination lemma will absorb it,
    because `ω ^ α` is additively indecomposable.

The recursion has two layers.  A well-founded recursion on `β ⊕ γ` handles
every case that consumes an ordinal; a structural induction on each derivation
handles `contraction`, which does not consume one. -/

/-! ### The principal cases

Each of the four principal cases is a lemma of its own, because each runs a
*second* structural induction — on the right derivation — in order to find the
rule that introduced `∼φ`.  They take the outer induction hypothesis as an
argument; `RedIH` names its shape. -/

principal-case lemmas can take the outer induction hypothesis as an argument. -/

/-- The same statement, but indexed by the *symmetric* measure `β ⊕ γ` rather
than by the left ordinal alone.

The quantifier principal cases force this.  Their second cut premise is obtained
by running the reduction with the two sides *swapped* — the right premise becomes
the left, and the whole left derivation becomes the right — and a measure that
counts only the left ordinal cannot see that as a decrease.  The natural sum
can, because it is commutative. -/

formula `χ ⋎ ρ`.

The induction is structural on the *right* derivation, which is what locates the
`⋏` that introduced `∼(χ ⋎ ρ)`.  Once found, all three inputs to the two cuts
come from `ih2`, at the pairs `(α₀, δ)`, `(α, δ₀)` and `(α, δ₁)`, each below
`(α, δ)` in the natural sum.  `NONote.mid` supplies the value the inner cut runs
at, which is the one thing the textbook bound `α ⊕ δ` cannot provide. -/

/-- Principal case for `∃`: the left derivation ended by introducing `∃¹ χ` with
some witness `t₀`, and the right derivation introduced `∀¹ ∼χ`.

This is the case that rules out the whole inversion-based strategy.  There is no
inversion for `∃` — the witness a derivation chose is not recoverable from its
conclusion — so the only way to line the two sides up is to take `t₀` from the
*left* premise and instantiate the right one at it, which the substitution lemma
does.

It is also the case that forces the symmetric measure.  The second cut premise
is the right premise instantiated at `t₀`, and it still carries `∼(∃¹ χ)` in its
own context; scrubbing that means running the reduction with the sides swapped,
at the pair `(δ₀, α)`, which is below `(α, δ)` only in the natural sum. -/

/-- Principal case for `∀`: the left derivation ended by introducing `∀¹ χ`, and
the right derivation introduced `∃¹ ∼χ` with some witness `t`.

Mirror image of the existential case: the witness comes from the *right* premise
and the left premise is instantiated at it.  Again no inversion is used, and
again the second cut premise is produced by running the reduction with the sides
swapped.

The non-principal cases are written differently from the propositional lemmas,
and better.  They hand `ih2` the *whole* left derivation rather than its premise,
which matters in the right's `∀` case: that rule shifts the context, and
shifting a whole derivation is immediate, whereas shifting a premise of the form
`χ.free :: Γˡ⁺` is not — `free` and `shift` do not commute, they disagree about
where the fresh variable lands. -/

/-- **Reduction.**  Two derivations that cut against each other on a formula of
complexity at most `r` combine into one that uses only cuts of complexity below
`r`.

The ordinal is `(β ⊕ γ) ⊕ (β ⊕ γ)` rather than the textbook `β ⊕ γ`.  The
propositional principal cases perform two *nested* cuts, the second taking the
first's result as a premise, so they need two strictly increasing ordinals above
everything the induction hypotheses return, and the natural sum alone supplies
only one.  Doubling repairs it and survives the recursion; the elimination
lemma will not notice, because `ω ^ α` is additively indecomposable. -/
